* No retain stack is necessary, since we can store the Factor stack in a lexically scoped PMC

* Any function not inlined must have a constant stack effect, i.e. a fixed
number of inputs and outputs.  Thus, it should be possible to map stack
shuffling in between function calls into register/PMC moves/copies. In theory.
