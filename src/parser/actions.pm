kea::Grammar::Actions - ast transformations for kea

This file contains the methods that are used by the parse grammar
to build the PAST representation of an kea program.
Each method below corresponds to a rule in F<src/parser/grammar.pg>,
and is invoked at the point where C<{*}> appears in the rule,
with the current match object as the first argument.  If the
line containing C<{*}> also has a C<#= key> comment, then the
value of the comment is passed as the second argument to the method.

method TOP($/) {
    my $past := PAST::Block.new( :blocktype('declaration'), :node( $/ ) );
    for $<statement> {
        $past.push( $( $_ ) );
    }
    make $past;

##  expression:
##    This is one of the more complex transformations, because
##    our grammar is using the operator precedence parser here.
##    As each node in the expression tree is reduced by the
##    parser, it invokes this method with the operator node as
##    the match object and a $key of 'reduce'.  We then build
##    a PAST::Op node using the information provided by the
##    operator node.  (Any traits for the node are held in $<top>.)
##    Finally, when the entire expression is parsed, this method
##    is invoked with the expression in $<expr> and a $key of 'end'.

                                  :pirop($<top><pirop>),
                                  :lvalue($<top><lvalue>),
                                  :node($/)

##  term:
##    Like 'statement' above, the $key has been set to let us know
##    which term subrule was matched.
